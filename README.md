#circle
Project for CS313E; Solves the Josephus problem using a circular linked list.

#using josephus.txt
Line 1 is the number of soldiers in the circle.
Line 2 is where to start counting for deletion.
Line 3 is where to delete.

#deeper explanation
A circular linked list is created, soldiers are sequentially added to the list, and they are deleted by counting from start to n places after start, including start in the count.
As soldiers are deleted from the list, their number is printed to the terminal.
